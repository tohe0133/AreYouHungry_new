# AreYouHungry website


## Requirements
This website requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), a Python IDE (like [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)), Flask and SQLite3 to run. 
Make sure you have Python and a IDE installed before you start the installation.

## Installation and Usage
### Step 1
Start by installing Flask and SQlite3.
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install these.
```bash
pip install Flask
```
```bash
pip install pysqlite3
```

### Step 2
Open rest_db.py with an IDE and run it. This will create the SQLite3 database.

### Step 3
Open areYouHungry_controller.py with an IDE and run it.
Click on the link in the Run-terminal, and you are taken to the website.
You are now good to go!
